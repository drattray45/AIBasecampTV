description: Use when the user is building or refactoring UI in their product codebase and wants designer-quality frontend code — not just functional code. Triggers on phrases like "design better", "make this UI feel more designed", "elevate the design quality", "build this with design best practices", "follow UX heuristics", "make this feel professional", "apply design polish", "review this for craft", or any request to apply UX/UI craft heuristics to code generation or review. Pairs with `docs/DESIGN.md`: the design system file owns **style** (colors, typography, spacing tokens, components), this skill owns **craft** (hierarchy, interaction, accessibility, motion, polish). Reference DESIGN.md tokens by name for every visual decision; apply the 50-item heuristics catalogue below for every craft decision. When a heuristic implies a token DESIGN.md doesn't have, flag it as a New Pattern for `studio-build-design-review` to promote — never invent a value inline.

# Build: Design Better

A craft layer for any coding agent generating or reviewing UI. Style is owned by `docs/DESIGN.md`; this skill owns the timeless UX/UI craft heuristics — drawn from Nielsen Norman Group, Laws of UX, Shneiderman, Refactoring UI, WCAG 2.2, Don Norman, Apple HIG, Material 3, and 2025–2026 AI-product patterns — that separate "shipped" from "designed."

> **Boundary.** When a heuristic implies a visual property, reference a DESIGN.md token by name (`{colors.primary}`, `{rounded.md}`). If DESIGN.md doesn't have the token, flag as a New Pattern — never inline hex, font names, or arbitrary px.

## Inputs

- **`docs/DESIGN.md`** — required. If missing, stop and tell the user to run `studio-design-design-system`.
- **The thing being built or refactored** — a brief, a file, or uncommitted diff.
- **`design/1. Product Identity.md`** and **`docs/PRODUCT.md`** — optional. Identity informs microcopy tone; PRODUCT.md helps weight which heuristic categories dominate.

## Workflow

1. **Read `docs/DESIGN.md`.** Parse the token catalogue (colors, typography, rounded, spacing, components) and the markdown rules (elevation, shape, Do's and Don'ts).

2. **Confirm scope and weight.** Restate the surface (signup / dashboard / chat / settings / detail / marketing) and which heuristic categories will dominate — a signup leans on Forms + States + Accessibility + Microcopy; a data dashboard leans on Hierarchy + IA + Cognitive Load; an AI chat leans on the AI-product subset.

3. **Generate or review using both layers.** DESIGN.md tokens for every visual decision; the heuristics catalogue for every craft decision. Cite heuristics by number in reviews (*"H22 — disabled instead of erroring after submit"*).

4. **Pre-flight checklist before delivering:**
   - Every interactive element has default, hover/focus-visible, active, disabled, and loading (where async) states.
   - Every async surface designs and codes all four states: empty, loading, error, success.
   - Every form input has a programmatically associated `<label>`, the correct `inputmode`/`type`, an `autocomplete` attribute, and `onBlur` validation.
   - Every motion is 150–400 ms, eases by direction (out entering / in exiting / in-out moving), animates `transform`/`opacity` only, and honors `prefers-reduced-motion`.
   - Body text contrast ≥ 4.5:1, UI components ≥ 3:1, focus rings ≥ 3:1 at ≥ 2 px.
   - Pointer targets ≥ 24×24 CSS px (≥ 44×44 on touch).
   - Layout works at 320 CSS px wide with no horizontal scroll.
   - The primary action is the single visually dominant element on the view.
   - Every visual decision references a DESIGN.md token. Missing tokens flagged as New Patterns, not invented inline.

5. **Deliver.** Note which heuristic categories dominated and surface any trade-off where a heuristic was knowingly skipped.

## The heuristics catalogue (50 items)

Each entry: number (cite in reviews) + short name + one-line rule + code action. Style-neutral throughout — defer every visual property to `docs/DESIGN.md`.

### Visual hierarchy & emphasis

**H1. One primary action per view (Von Restorff).** Make the primary CTA the single visually distinct element — use the most prominent DESIGN.md color and largest button size. Secondary actions use quieter tokens.

**H2. Hierarchy from size + weight + color, not size alone (Refactoring UI).** De-emphasize secondary text by reducing weight or shifting to a secondary text color token before reducing font size.

**H3. Proximity groups, white space separates (Gestalt).** Stack related fields with a small `gap`; separate unrelated groups with a larger spacing token.

**H4. Common Region bounds groups (Gestalt).** When proximity isn't enough, bound with a card, divider, or tinted surface — using DESIGN.md elevation/surface tokens.

**H5. White space is a tool — default to too much (Refactoring UI).** Generous padding reads as confident. Tightening should be deliberate, not default.

**H6. Snap to the spacing scale; nothing one pixel off (Polish).** Every margin/padding/gap is a DESIGN.md token. Alignment to the grid is the difference between "designed" and "drafted."

### Layout & alignment

**H7. Semantic HTML before divs + ARIA (WCAG 1.3.1).** Use `<main>`, `<nav>`, `<header>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<button>`, `<label>`. Reach for `role=` only when no native element fits.

**H8. Reading line length 50–75ch.** Cap prose containers with `max-width: 65ch` (or analogous).

**H9. Reflow at 320 CSS px (WCAG 1.4.10).** Every view works at 320 px wide with no horizontal scroll.

**H10. Text spacing tolerance (WCAG 1.4.12).** Layout survives user overrides of line-height (≥ 1.5×), letter-spacing (≥ 0.12em), word-spacing (≥ 0.16em).

### Typography craft

**H11. Use only documented type levels.** Every `font-size`/`font-weight` references a DESIGN.md typography token.

**H12. Tabular figures in data (`font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums`).** Numbers in tables, dashboards, and ledgers align vertically.

**H13. Modern text-wrap (`balance` on headlines, `pretty` on prose).** Headlines read more deliberately with `text-wrap: balance`; body paragraphs avoid orphans with `text-wrap: pretty`.

### Color & contrast (non-stylistic)

**H14. Body text contrast ≥ 4.5:1 (WCAG 1.4.3 AA).** Verify every body/background token pair. Large text (≥18.66 px bold or ≥24 px) needs ≥ 3:1.

**H15. UI component contrast ≥ 3:1 (WCAG 1.4.11).** Form borders, icon-only buttons, focus rings, chart strokes all need ≥ 3:1 vs adjacent color.

**H16. Color is never the sole signal.** Pair every color-encoded state with an icon, label, or pattern.

### Interaction & feedback

**H17. Feedback within 100 ms (Doherty / Norman).** Every action that triggers logic confirms visually within 100 ms (press state, ripple, optimistic update, skeleton).

**H18. Three-state minimum for interactive elements.** Default, hover or focus-visible, active, disabled. Loading is a fifth where async.

**H19. Affordances signal interactivity.** Buttons look pressable; links visibly differ from body text — use DESIGN.md tokens for the visual treatment.

**H20. Discoverability over hidden interactions (Norman).** Critical actions are visible by default — never hidden behind hover, long-press, or undisclosed gestures.

**H21. Easy reversal (Shneiderman).** Undo on destructive actions; Cancel on every modal; Back without data loss; soft-delete with restore.

**H22. Constraints prevent errors (Norman).** Disable invalid options; use `min`, `max`, `step`, `pattern`, `type` on inputs; gate submit on validity.

### Forms

**H23. Single-column layout, top-aligned labels.** Stack vertically; labels above inputs; never placeholder-as-label.

**H24. `inputmode` + `type` for mobile keyboards.** `type="email"`, `inputmode="numeric"`/`"decimal"`, `type="tel"`, `type="url"`.

**H25. `autocomplete` attributes.** `email`, `name`, `new-password`, `one-time-code`, `postal-code`, etc. Saves users 30 seconds and respects password managers.

**H26. Inline validation on blur, clear on change.** Validate `onBlur`; clear errors `onChange` once valid. Validating every keystroke punishes typos.

**H27. Smart defaults absorb complexity (Tesler).** Detect timezone, locale, currency; pre-select the safe option; parse natural language ("tomorrow 3 pm"); pre-fill from previous inputs.

### States: empty, loading, error, success

**H28. Four states, every data view.** Empty, loading, error, success — each designed and coded using DESIGN.md tokens.

**H29. Skeleton over spinner for content (NN/g).** Use shape-matching placeholders that match final layout dimensions (prevents CLS).

**H30. Optimistic UI for low-risk actions.** Likes, toggles, follows update immediately; reconcile silently; rollback with a toast on failure.

**H31. Empty states are first impressions.** Every empty list has a one-line explanation of what should be there + a primary CTA.

**H32. Errors say what / why / how to fix.** Never just "Something went wrong." Always offer a retry or recovery path.

### Motion

**H33. UI motion in the 150–400 ms band (NN/g, Material 3).** Micro 100–150 ms (hover, toggle); standard 200–300 ms (menu, modal); large 300–400 ms (page transition). Repeated UI never animates over 500 ms.

**H34. Easing matches direction.** Ease-out entering (`cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0.2, 1)`); ease-in exiting; ease-in-out for moves between two on-screen states.

**H35. Animate `transform` and `opacity` only.** GPU-accelerated. Never animate `width`/`height`/`top`/`left`.

**H36. Honor `prefers-reduced-motion`.** Wrap non-essential motion in `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)`. Replace transforms with instant changes or short opacity fades — never remove the feedback signal entirely.

### Accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA)

**H37. Keyboard operability for everything (WCAG 2.1.1).** Every interactive element reachable via Tab / Shift+Tab / Enter / Space / Arrow. Focus traps in modals work.

**H38. Visible focus rings (WCAG 2.4.7).** Never `outline: none` without a `:focus-visible` equivalent — ≥ 2 px, ≥ 3:1 contrast. Use a DESIGN.md focus token if defined.

**H39. Pointer target size ≥ 24×24 (WCAG 2.5.8).** Every clickable element ≥ 24×24 CSS px. On touch, aim for 44×44 (Apple HIG) or 48×48 (Material 3).

**H40. Programmatically associated labels (WCAG 3.3.2).** Every input has a `<label htmlFor=id>` or wraps the input. `aria-label` only when the input is genuinely unlabeled visually.

**H41. Focus not obscured (WCAG 2.4.11).** Sticky headers/footers must not cover the focused element. Set `scroll-padding-top`/`-bottom` equal to sticky heights.

**H42. Accessible authentication (WCAG 3.3.8).** No cognitive puzzles for login. Allow paste in password fields. Pair OTP with `autocomplete="one-time-code"`.

### Mobile & touch

**H43. Thumb-zone primary CTAs.** On mobile, primary actions land in the bottom half. Avoid top corners for high-frequency actions.

**H44. Respect safe-area insets.** Use `env(safe-area-inset-*)` on fixed/sticky bottom bars and full-bleed headers.

**H45. No hover-only critical info.** Tooltips shown only on `:hover` are invisible on touch. Show critical content by default.

**H46. Drag has a tap alternative (WCAG 2.5.7).** Every drag-to-sort/delete/resize has a button or menu equivalent.

### Cognitive load & navigation

**H47. Navigation ≤ 5–9 items (Miller).** Top-level nav stays inside the magic number; push the rest into a menu, command palette, or settings.

**H48. Recognition over Recall (NN/g #6).** Surface selected filters, current page (active nav state), breadcrumbs, recent items. Never make the user remember a value from a previous screen.

### AI-product specifics (2025–2026)

**H49. Stream + Stop is a primary control.** AI responses stream as they generate; a visible Stop button at primary affordance weight while streaming aborts the underlying request, not just the UI. Tool calls / thinking / searching surface as labeled steps.

**H50. AI output is an editable draft.** Treat model responses as drafts users can edit, accept partially, regenerate, or reject. Cite sources inline with one-click open. Distinguish error categories (network, rate limit, content filter, model error) so each has its own recovery path.

## What "done" looks like

Generated or reviewed UI where the **pre-flight checklist** in workflow step 4 passes in full, every visual decision references a DESIGN.md token, the primary action is the single visually dominant element (H1), microcopy is plain language, errors say what/why/how-to-fix (H32), the success moment is invested in (Peak-End Rule), and any token DESIGN.md doesn't yet have is flagged for promotion via `studio-build-design-review` rather than invented inline.

Recommended pairing: run `studio-build-design-review` before commit to catch token drift that slipped through.
