# BONUS - API and Developer Tool Onboarding Best Practice

*A bonus asset for The Product Studio — 12 principles, 18 tactics, and a decision tree pulled from teardowns of the highest-converting API and developer tools shipping today: Stripe (the $80B+ category-defining DX standard), Twilio (62% activation lift after their 2025 onboarding redesign), OpenAI, Anthropic, Resend, Vercel, Supabase, Postman, and Replit — plus the 2026 developer-experience benchmarks from Moesif, Nordic APIs, and Bessemer's developer-tools playbook.*

---

## The Meta-Rule

> **A developer is not evaluating your features. They are evaluating whether your product will save them or cost them an afternoon. Onboarding is the demonstration that the answer is "save" — measured by the seconds between landing on your homepage and receiving a working API response. Every UI element that does not directly compress that loop is friction the developer did not agree to pay for.**

The consumer playbook is persuasion, B2B is evidence, productized services is trust through speed. **Developer tools sell time.** Stripe built an $80B company by proving the time-to-payment was under 5 minutes when the alternative (Authorize.net, Worldpay) was 5 weeks of integration meetings. Twilio's 2025 onboarding redesign delivered a 62% lift in first-message activation by collapsing the same loop. The developer's first API call is your IPO.

---

## The Numbers That Set the Stakes

These are the 2026 benchmarks from Moesif's DX metrics report, Nordic APIs' "Time to First Call" data, Bessemer's developer-tools playbook, and the documented metrics from Stripe, Twilio, Supabase, and Vercel.

| Metric | Number | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The single most important developer-tool metric | **Time to First Hello World (TTFHW)** | Moesif, Nordic APIs |
| Stripe homepage → first code sample | **0 clicks** (code pre-rendered on homepage) | Stripe historical teardown |
| Supabase sign-up → working Postgres + REST API | **~60 seconds** | Supabase ops |
| Twilio redesign — improvement in first-message activation | **+62%** | Twilio 2025 launch |
| Twilio redesign — production launches inside 7 days | **+33%** | Twilio 2025 launch |
| Anthropic new-account free credits | **~$5** | console.anthropic.com |
| OpenAI new-account free credits (post July 2025) | **$0** | OpenAI platform |
| % of Stripe integrations that complete without support contact | **80%+** | Stripe DX team |
| Share of API documentation traffic now coming from AI agents | **40%+** | Daily Dev 2026 |
| Conversion lift from a "Run in Postman" button vs. raw docs | **2–3x** more developers reach a working call | Postman case studies |
| Documentation-traffic-to-paid conversion (top-quartile dev tools) | **3–8% (free signup → paid)** | Bessemer playbook |
| GitHub Copilot pricing transition (June 2026) | Request-based → **credits-based usage billing** | GitHub announcement |
| Vertical AI agents share of documentation requests projected by 2027 | **>60%** | Industry trend lines |

The number that should change how you build: **Stripe documentation now has a 40%+ AI-agent traffic share.** Your docs are not just a marketing surface anymore — they are training data for the AI coding assistants making the integration choice. If your endpoints are not crisp, structured, machine-readable, and example-rich, the LLM will choose your competitor in `cursor`, `claude`, or `copilot` autocompletion and the human will never see your name.

---

## The 12 Principles

These are the mental models that show up across every winning developer-tool teardown.

### 1. Time to First Hello World Is the Whole Game

TTFHW measures the elapsed seconds from "I found your product" to "I made a successful API call and got a 200 back." Below 5 minutes is the modern bar. Below 60 seconds is best-in-class (Supabase, Resend). Above 30 minutes is functionally dead — the developer has tabbed back to a competitor. **Every other metric in your funnel is downstream of TTFHW.**

### 2. The Homepage Is a Code Sample, Not a Hero Image

Stripe's historical homepage had a 7-line cURL example *above the fold* with the API key already injected from the signed-in user's account. The marketing copy was the code. Resend, Supabase, and every modern API-first product converges on this pattern: working code, copy-paste ready, syntax-highlighted, with multiple language tabs. The marketing tagline lives *next to* the code, not in place of it.

### 3. Documentation Is the Product

Stripe's 80%+ no-support-needed integration rate is a documentation outcome, not a product outcome. Docs are not a help center — they are the second product you ship. They live with versioning, design reviews, dedicated writers, and conversion telemetry. Twilio embeds documentation links inside *error messages* so a 400 response is itself a tutorial. **Treat docs as a top-three engineering surface, not as marketing.**

### 4. Test Mode Before Real Mode

Stripe's `sk_test_*` key is the canonical innovation — a fully working API key that touches a sandbox identical to production but with fake money. The developer can prove the integration works end-to-end *before* touching their company's real Stripe account, real billing, or real customer data. Every API-first product needs this: a sandbox key issued instantly on signup, with sample data already populated. **No "fill out KYC then we send you the key" friction. Key first, KYC at first real transaction.**

### 5. The "Run in Postman" Button Is the New CTA

Static curl examples are 2024. The 2026 standard is one-click import to Postman, Insomnia, Bruno, or the developer's local REPL. Postman's data: a "Run in Postman" button drives 2–3x more developers to a working call than raw documentation. The same applies to embedded sandboxes in docs (`api.stripe.com` runnable code blocks), live API playgrounds, and copy-paste cURL with their key pre-filled. **Make the working call the easier path.**

### 6. Three Languages, One Truth

Every API call in docs should ship with at minimum three language tabs: cURL (universal), JavaScript/TypeScript (web), and Python (AI/scripts). Add a fourth for your top vertical — Go for infra products, Ruby for indie devs, Swift for mobile-first. The order matters: cURL first (proves the API), then the dev's language. Stripe ships 12+ language tabs; OpenAI ships ~8. **The right floor is three, the right ceiling is whatever your audience uses.**

### 7. The Sandbox Is Pre-Populated

A working API key on an empty account is a developer-tool empty state. They make their first call, get back `{"data": []}`, and bounce. Pre-populate the sandbox with realistic objects — sample customers, test transactions, demo conversations — so the first response is a meaningful payload, not an empty array. Stripe's test mode ships with sample customers and disputes. OpenAI's playground ships with example prompts. **The sandbox must contain proof the API works.**

### 8. Errors Are Onboarding Surfaces

Every error response is a teaching moment. Twilio's documented pattern: error responses include the documentation URL, a `request_id` (for support), and a human-readable `more_info` field. Stripe's error responses link directly to the relevant API reference. The developer who hits an error and finds a link to the fix in 5 seconds becomes a customer. The one who hits an error with no context tabs to a competitor. **Design error responses with the same care as the happy path.**

### 9. Usage Visibility From Day One

The dashboard a developer lands on after their first call must show: requests made, errors thrown, latency, and credits/usage burned. This is the developer-tool equivalent of mobile's "personalized plan reveal" — proof the product is working *on them* in real time. OpenAI's usage dashboard, Anthropic's Console, Vercel's deployment dashboard all do this. **A developer who can see their own metrics within 5 minutes of signup is a developer who's bought in.**

### 10. Docs Are Now Training Data, Not Marketing Copy

40%+ of documentation traffic is now AI agents (Cursor, Claude, Copilot) scraping for autocompletion context. If your API docs are not crisp OpenAPI specs, with structured examples, clean schemas, and machine-readable endpoint descriptions, your competitor's docs will rank higher *inside the AI coding assistant the developer is using* — and the human will never see your name. The 2026 docs imperative: **rank in `cursor` and `claude` first, on Google second.**

### 11. Self-Serve Through the First Production Call

Sales calls for developer tools should not happen below a deliberate ACV (~$5K MRR usage). Below that threshold, every "Talk to sales" gate is a developer tabbing back to a competitor. Self-serve through to the first production API call — including billing setup, key rotation, rate-limit visibility, and pricing transparency. Stripe pioneered this; OpenAI, Anthropic, Vercel, Supabase all converged on it. **Sales joins the conversation when usage proves seriousness, not before.**

### 12. The Developer Brings the Team

Every developer evaluating your tool is implicitly evaluating it for their team. Onboarding must surface team-invite, shared workspace, and SSO well before billing. The activation metric that predicts enterprise expansion is not "first call" — it is "second developer invited to the same workspace." Supabase, Vercel, Linear all build this into the first-week experience. **The first developer is the trojan horse for the contract.**

---

## The Decision Tree — Which Onboarding Pattern Should You Build?

Start at the top. Stop at the first "yes."

**Is your product a pure API (no UI of its own — Stripe, Twilio, OpenAI, Resend, Anthropic)?**
→ Run **#1 The cURL-on-the-Homepage Funnel.** Homepage = working code sample → instant test key → sandbox response in <60 seconds.

**Is your product a developer platform with UI + API (Supabase, Vercel, Firebase, MongoDB Atlas)?**
→ Run **#2 The Dashboard-First Funnel.** Sign-up → provisioned project → working endpoint in dashboard → CLI/SDK download → first deploy in <5 min.

**Is your product a CLI / IDE / local-first dev tool (Cursor, Vercel CLI, Supabase CLI)?**
→ Run **#3 The One-Command Install Funnel.** Homepage = single install command → tool works on their existing repo → first AI action / deploy / build inside 2 minutes.

**Is your product a marketplace / agent platform / sandboxed environment (Replit, GPT Store, Cloudflare Workers)?**
→ Run **#4 The Run-in-Browser Funnel.** First action happens in the browser before signup. Signup gates "save" / "deploy" / "publish."

**Is your product low-code / no-code dev-adjacent (Zapier, Make, n8n, AI builders)?**
→ Run **#5 The Template-First Funnel.** Curated template gallery → one-click clone → working automation in <10 minutes.

**None of the above and you're stuck?**
→ Default to **#1 cURL-on-the-Homepage Funnel.** It is the highest-EV pattern for any API-first product. Optimize from there.

---

## The 18 Tactics

Organized by stage. Build top-to-bottom.

---

### Stage 1 — The Homepage (the first 60 seconds)

#### 1. The Working Code Above the Fold

**Why:** Stripe's homepage had a 7-line cURL example above the fold for nearly a decade. Resend opens with a `curl --request POST` block. Supabase opens with `npx create-supabase-app`. The marketing copy is the code. The visitor evaluating the tool is shown — not told — that the API exists and is simple. This is the single most-copied pattern in modern developer-tool sales pages.

**Pass threshold:** Working code visible above the fold on the marketing homepage, with at least one runnable language tab (cURL, JS, or Python).

#### 2. The Multi-Language Tab

**Why:** Different developers think in different languages. cURL proves the API; JavaScript proves the SDK; Python proves the AI/script story. One language is a marketing decision; three is a product decision. Stripe ships 12+. OpenAI ships ~8. The floor is three.

**Pass threshold:** Every code block in docs and on the homepage has ≥3 language tabs.

#### 3. The Pricing Page With Free Tier Math

**Why:** Developers want to know what it costs *before* they sign up. A pricing page with a clear free tier ("$0/month, 100 free requests/day"), transparent overage pricing ("$0.005/request after that"), and a calculator that shows their estimated cost based on their use case lifts signups meaningfully. Hide the price and they assume it's expensive.

**Pass threshold:** Pricing page visible from the homepage nav, free tier listed first, calculator (or worked examples) for usage-based products.

---

### Stage 2 — Signup (the next 60 seconds)

#### 4. SSO + Email-Only Signup

**Why:** GitHub OAuth is non-negotiable for developer tools — it auto-populates the developer's identity, repos, and team context. Google + Apple SSO for breadth. Email + password only as a fallback. Asking for company, role, or use-case during signup costs you ~10% per field. Defer everything but the email.

**Pass threshold:** GitHub OAuth visible above the email field. Signup form has ≤2 fields if email is used.

#### 5. The Instant Test Key

**Why:** The single moment that converts a curious developer to an evaluating developer is when a working API key lands in their dashboard. This must happen on signup — no email verification gate, no KYC, no "we'll be in touch." Stripe's `sk_test_*` key is provisioned in <2 seconds. Anthropic's API key takes one click. **Issue the key first; verify identity at first real-money transaction.**

**Pass threshold:** A working sandbox API key visible in the dashboard within 30 seconds of signup. Zero email-verification or KYC gates.

#### 6. The Onboarding Dashboard with a "First Call" CTA

**Why:** The dashboard a developer lands on after signup must feature one obvious next action: "Make your first call." Not "complete your profile," not "verify your email," not "watch the welcome video." A prominent code block, the user's own API key pre-injected, and a single button to copy it. Vercel does this; Supabase does this; Resend does this.

**Pass threshold:** Dashboard first-paint shows the developer's own key embedded in a runnable code sample with a "Copy" button.

---

### Stage 3 — First API Call (the next 5 minutes)

#### 7. The Pre-Populated Sandbox

**Why:** A test key on an empty account returns empty arrays. Pre-populate the sandbox with realistic objects — Stripe ships test customers and sample disputes; OpenAI's playground ships with example prompts; Supabase's new project ships with a `users` table. The first API call should return a meaningful payload, not `[]`.

**Pass threshold:** First API call returns at least 3 realistic sample objects from a pre-populated sandbox.

#### 8. The Documentation Sidekick

**Why:** The developer making their first call needs documentation *adjacent* to the action, not in a separate tab. Stripe's split-pane (description on the left, code on the right, both synced) is the canonical reference. The right-pane code is always copy-paste ready. The left pane explains the parameters in plain English. Errors in the docs are dogfooded against the live API.

**Pass threshold:** Documentation uses a split-pane (or equivalent) layout. Code blocks are interactive or runnable in-page.

#### 9. The Error Response That Teaches

**Why:** A 400 error from Stripe contains: `type`, `code`, `message`, `param`, and a documentation URL. The developer who hits an error and finds the fix in 5 seconds becomes a customer. The one who hits an error with `{"error": "bad request"}` and no context tabs to a competitor. Twilio embeds doc links *in the error response itself*. **Errors are an onboarding surface.**

**Pass threshold:** Every error response contains a stable error code, human-readable message, and a doc URL linking to the relevant section.

---

### Stage 4 — First Production Call (the next hour)

#### 10. The Production Key Rotation

**Why:** Moving from test to production must be one click — and the developer needs to understand exactly what changes. The dashboard should clearly separate sandbox keys from production keys, with a visible "rotate" button, key prefixes (`sk_test_*` vs `sk_live_*`) that make the environment obvious in code, and webhook signing secrets handled the same way.

**Pass threshold:** Production key generation is a single click from the dashboard. Test and production environments are visually distinct.

#### 11. The Webhook Tester

**Why:** Webhooks are where developers get stuck — they cannot inspect a localhost endpoint from the public internet. Stripe ships the Stripe CLI for webhook forwarding. Twilio ships `ngrok` integrations. Modern tools ship in-dashboard webhook testers that fire sample events on demand. The webhook is the second-hardest part of the integration; ship the easy path.

**Pass threshold:** Dashboard contains a "test webhook" button that fires real events against the developer's endpoint, plus CLI tooling for local forwarding.

#### 12. The "Working in Production" Checklist

**Why:** Before the developer flips to live mode, surface a checklist: "Webhook signatures verified? Rate limit handling tested? Idempotency keys set? Error responses logged?" This is the developer-tool equivalent of the activation checklist. Stripe's "going live" checklist is the canonical reference.

**Pass threshold:** Pre-production checklist visible in the dashboard with ≥5 items pulled from real failure modes.

---

### Stage 5 — Team & Billing (the next day)

#### 13. The Team Invite at First Real Usage

**Why:** A developer working alone is a hobby project. A developer working with a team is a contract. Surface the invite flow at the moment of first production-shaped usage — second key created, first webhook configured, first 1,000 requests. The trigger is behavioral, not nag-based.

**Pass threshold:** Team invite prompt fires on the first production-shaped behavior with at least one pre-filled suggested teammate.

#### 14. The Usage Dashboard With Forecasted Cost

**Why:** "You've used 12,400 requests this month. At current pace, you'll hit $48 by the end of the month." This single sentence on the dashboard is worth more than a marketing campaign — it makes the unit economics obvious and turns budget anxiety into budget confidence. OpenAI, Anthropic, Vercel all surface this prominently.

**Pass threshold:** Dashboard shows current month-to-date usage, current cost, and forecasted end-of-month cost.

#### 15. The Self-Serve Upgrade

**Why:** Upgrading from free to paid must require zero human contact below ~$5K MRR. Stripe Checkout in the dashboard. Card on file. Automatic plan selection based on usage. The 2026 winning trigger: "You'll exceed the free tier in 4 days. Add a card to keep service running." Sent at 75% of free-tier consumption, not at 100%.

**Pass threshold:** Free → paid upgrade is a one-click flow. Trigger fires at 75% of free-tier limit, not at 100%.

---

### Stage 6 — The Long Game (week 2+)

#### 16. The AI-Coding-Assistant Optimization

**Why:** The new SEO is being indexed correctly by Cursor, Claude Code, and GitHub Copilot. Your docs must ship as crisp OpenAPI specs, with clean schemas, structured examples, and machine-readable endpoint descriptions. The AI assistants are now 40%+ of doc traffic — and they make the choice the human sees in autocomplete. If your competitor's docs rank in the LLM and yours don't, you lose the integration before the human even Googles the problem.

**Pass threshold:** Public OpenAPI spec maintained as a versioned artifact. Docs include `llms.txt` and structured schema metadata for LLM consumption.

#### 17. The Changelog as Marketing

**Why:** A weekly changelog ("we shipped these endpoints, these SDK improvements, these breaking changes") is the cheapest, highest-trust marketing surface for a developer tool. Stripe, OpenAI, Linear, Vercel all run public changelogs as core marketing. The developer who reads the changelog is a developer who already cares.

**Pass threshold:** Public changelog updated at least weekly with shipped changes. RSS / email subscription available.

#### 18. The Public API Reference With Live Examples

**Why:** Static API reference docs lose to the modern bar: live, runnable, sandboxed examples that hit a real test environment from inside the documentation page itself. Stripe's docs are the canonical reference — every endpoint is interactively testable inside the page with the developer's own API key. **This is the doc surface that converts.**

**Pass threshold:** API reference docs include runnable example blocks that hit the real API (test mode) with the developer's signed-in key.

## Worked Example 1 — The Stripe Funnel Reconstructed

This is the Stripe flow as documented across the Stripe documentation, Cristiano Betta's DX teardowns, and the Bessemer DX playbook. Stripe became the **$80B+ category-defining payments API** by making the integration so fast that the alternative (Authorize.net, Worldpay) became professionally embarrassing.

| Step | Pattern | Why It Works |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Homepage: 7-line cURL with logged-in user's API key pre-injected | Working code above the fold | 0 clicks to first code |
| 2. GitHub / Google SSO signup | SSO + email-only | Zero friction |
| 3. Sandbox API key (sk_test_*) provisioned instantly | Instant test key | Working key in <30 seconds |
| 4. Test-mode dashboard pre-loaded with sample customers, charges, disputes | Pre-populated sandbox | First call returns meaningful data |
| 5. Stripe CLI: `stripe listen --forward-to localhost` | Webhook tester | Hardest part of integration solved out of the box |
| 6. Docs in split-pane: description left, code right, language tabs (12+) | Documentation sidekick | Reference and examples in one surface |
| 7. Error responses include `code`, `message`, `param`, and doc URL | Errors that teach | Self-service debugging |
| 8. "Going Live" checklist before key rotation | Production checklist | Reduces post-launch incidents |
| 9. One-click sandbox → production key rotation | Production key rotation | Test-to-live is trivial |
| 10. Dashboard shows real-time MRR, transactions, fees, forecasted spend | Usage dashboard with forecast | Business KPIs visible from day 1 |

**Result:** $80B+ valuation. ~80% of integrations completed with zero support contact. The dominant payments API by every metric. The DX playbook that defined a decade.

---

## Worked Example 2 — The Twilio 2025 Redesign

In 2025, Twilio overhauled their onboarding from a generic "wizard" to a personalized, embedded-tutorial flow. **Result: +62% improvement in first-message activation, +33% improvement in production launches within 7 days.** The redesign is the canonical reference for re-onboarding a mature developer tool.

| Step | Pattern | Why It Works |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Sign up with role + code preference + use case | Routing question | Personalizes the next 20 minutes |
| 2. Branched onboarding: SMS vs. Voice vs. Verify vs. Flex | Use-case-specific flow | Right path for right developer |
| 3. Embedded tutorial inside the console | Documentation sidekick | No tab-switching |
| 4. Pre-filled code samples with the developer's Twilio number | Pre-populated sandbox | First send is on their actual account |
| 5. "Hello World" milestone tracker (signup → first send → production) | Activation checklist | Visible progress drives completion |
| 6. Error responses include doc links inside the error body | Errors that teach | Self-service debugging |
| 7. Production-ready review built into the console flow | Production checklist | Reduces churn at launch |
| 8. CLI for local development | One-command install | Native to dev workflows |

**Result:** +62% first-message activation, +33% production launches within 7 days. Mature-product onboarding can still drive double-digit lifts with the right framework.

---

## Worked Example 3 — The Modern AI API Stack (OpenAI / Anthropic / Resend)

The 2026 archetype: API-first products that ship a 30-second time-to-first-response, instant key issuance, and a playground for non-code experimentation. OpenAI removed its $5 free starter credit in July 2025 — Anthropic still issues ~$5 in starter credits. This is a deliberate choice: **the starter credit is the test-key-with-real-money for AI APIs.**

| Step | Pattern | Why It Works |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Homepage with API call example for the flagship model | Working code on homepage | Wow moment before signup |
| 2. SSO signup, optional org name | SSO-only | Frictionless |
| 3. API key issued instantly, $5 starter credits applied | Instant test key | Real-money proof on first call |
| 4. Playground UI for non-code experimentation | Pre-populated sandbox + UI sandbox | Lowers the bar to first response |
| 5. Three-tab docs: cURL / JS / Python | Multi-language tabs | Universal coverage |
| 6. Usage dashboard with real-time spend, model breakdown, latency | Usage visibility | Cost transparency from minute 1 |
| 7. Pre-built workspace for team invite (Anthropic Workspaces, OpenAI Org) | Team invite at first real usage | Enterprise expansion path baked in |
| 8. Production-grade rate limits exposed in dashboard | Rate-limit visibility | Capacity planning is transparent |
| 9. Self-serve upgrade to higher tiers / committed-use discounts | Self-serve upgrade | Sales joins later |
| 10. OpenAPI spec + `llms.txt` for AI-coding-assistant optimization | AI-coding-assistant docs | Wins inside Cursor / Claude Code |

**Result:** OpenAI and Anthropic both grew their developer API revenue from $0 to billions inside 24 months on the back of this funnel — and 70%+ of new AI products built in 2025–2026 use this exact stack.

---

## Anti-Patterns — What Kills Developer Tool Onboarding

These are the recurring failure patterns from the teardowns.

### The "Talk to Sales" Wall

A "Contact Sales" button instead of a signup form. For developer tools under ~$5K MRR ACV, this is a 95%+ conversion loss. Developers want to evaluate before talking. **Default to self-serve. Sales joins later.**

### The Email-Verification Gate Before the Key

A 30-second pause for "verify your email" before the test key is issued. The developer's attention budget evaporates in that pause. **Issue the key on signup. Verify email when the developer first triggers a billing action.**

### The Empty Sandbox

A test API key that returns `{"data": []}` on the first call. The developer thinks the API is broken or empty. **Pre-populate the sandbox with realistic objects so the first response is proof of value.**

### The Single-Language Code Sample

Stripe-style cURL only — and nothing else. The Python developer tabs to a competitor that ships a Python SDK example. **Three language tabs minimum.**

### The Generic "Bad Request" Error

A 400 response with `{"error": "bad request"}` and no further context. The developer Googles your error message and finds nothing. **Every error response gets a code, a message, a param, and a documentation URL.**

### The 30-Page Quickstart

A "Getting Started" guide that takes 45 minutes to read before the first code sample. Developers skim — make the first code sample appear on screen 1, not screen 12.

### The Hidden Pricing Page

"Contact us for pricing" or no pricing page at all. The developer assumes you're expensive and tabs to a competitor with transparent pricing. **Show the price. Show the free tier. Show a calculator.**

### The "Production" Wall Without Test Mode

A product that ships only with live keys, forcing the developer to test against real data, real money, or real users. **Sandbox / test mode is non-negotiable. Stripe set this bar in 2011.**

### The Docs That Lie

Documentation that doesn't match the actual API behavior. The developer copy-pastes the example, gets an error, loses trust forever. **Dogfood your docs against your live API in CI. Every doc example must be a tested code path.**

### The Webhook Black Box

A webhook system with no inspector, no replay, and no local-forwarding tool. The developer integrates webhooks blind, gets stuck, and gives up. **Ship the webhook tester. Ship the CLI forwarder.**

### Docs That Don't Rank in LLMs

Docs that look great in a browser but are not machine-readable. The AI coding assistant ranks your competitor's structured docs above yours and the human never sees you. **Ship the OpenAPI spec. Ship `llms.txt`. Optimize for LLM ingestion as a primary use case.**

## Calibration — What Good Looks Like

If your developer-tool onboarding is performing well, these are the marks to hit.

| Metric | Floor | Good | Best-in-class |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Time to First Hello World (TTFHW) | 30 min | 5 min | <60 sec |
| Homepage → signup conversion | 1.5% | 4% | 8%+ |
| Signup → first successful API call | 30% | 60% | 85%+ |
| First successful call → first production call | 8% | 20% | 40%+ |
| % of integrations completed without support contact | 50% | 70% | 80%+ |
| Trial → paid (self-serve) | 5% | 12% | 25%+ |
| Day-30 retention (paying developers) | 75% | 88% | 95%+ |
| % of paying accounts with a second team-member invited | 25% | 50% | 75%+ |
| Net revenue retention (NRR) | 100% | 120% | 140%+ |

If you are below the floor on TTFHW or signup → first call, the fix is almost never the pricing — it is the homepage code sample, the test-key flow, or the sandbox population. Re-read principles #1, #4, and #7.

## The Developer-Tool Operating Model

Four continuously-running functions:

**1. Docs as a versioned product.** Documentation has a roadmap, dedicated writers, design reviews, and conversion telemetry. Drop-offs on doc pages trigger a re-write.

**2. CI-tested doc examples.** Every code example in your documentation is a test that runs in CI. When the API changes, docs that break are flagged automatically.

**3. LLM-rank monitoring.** Track how your docs appear in Cursor / Claude Code / Copilot autocomplete. Optimize as you would for SEO — because for AI agents, this *is* the new SEO.

**4. Public changelog cadence.** Weekly changelog with shipped changes. RSS, email, and in-app surfacing. The changelog is your second-most-important marketing surface after docs.

---

## Closing — The One Mental Model That Beats Everything

> **A developer is mentally counting seconds. Every second between their decision to evaluate your tool and a working 200-response in their terminal is a second the competitor's homepage is one tab away. Your job is to drive that count to zero — through code samples that work the first time, sandboxes that contain proof, errors that explain themselves, and documentation that the AI assistant ranks first.**

Stripe became Stripe because the integration took 7 minutes instead of 7 weeks. OpenAI and Anthropic became platforms because the first API call took 30 seconds instead of 3 days. Twilio's 2025 redesign showed that even mature products can compound the same trick — they shaved seconds off the existing flow and got a 62% activation lift.

That is the playbook. Compress the loop. Show — don't tell — that the API works. Make the first call inevitable.
