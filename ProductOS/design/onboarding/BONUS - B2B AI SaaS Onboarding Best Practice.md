# BONUS - B2B AI SaaS Onboarding Best Practice

*A bonus asset for The Product Studio — 12 principles, 18 tactics, and a decision tree pulled from teardowns of the fastest-growing B2B AI products of the last 24 months: Cursor ($1M → $100M ARR in 12 months, $1B ARR in 24), Lovable ($0 → $200M ARR with zero paid acquisition, 85% Day 30 retention), Linear, Notion AI, Granola, Attio, Clay, Vercel, Supabase, Glean, Decagon, and Sierra — plus the 2026 benchmark datasets from ChartMogul, RevenueCat, Userpilot, OpenView, and ProductLed.*

## The Meta-Rule

> **In B2B AI SaaS, the user is not buying software. They are betting a workflow on you. Onboarding is the demonstration that the bet will pay off — in their actual environment, on their actual data, before the second team member is even invited. Every screen until that demonstration lands is friction.**

The mobile playbook of "ask 25 personalization questions before showing the product" does not work here. B2B AI buyers are sophisticated, time-constrained, and evaluating against three competitors at once. The winning pattern is the inverse of mobile: get the user to a real AI output on their real data inside 15 minutes, then layer personalization and team expansion after. Cursor hit $100M ARR with literally zero marketing because the first 5 minutes inside the editor sold every paying user.

## The Numbers That Set the Stakes

These are the 2026 benchmarks from ChartMogul (200 products), RevenueCat (115k apps, $16B revenue), Userpilot, OpenView's PLG benchmarks, and the Cursor and Lovable founder interviews. Read them before you design anything.

| Metric | Number | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| B2B SaaS average activation rate | **37.5%** | Userpilot 2026 |
| Activation rate in the AI/ML category specifically | **54.8%** | Userpilot 2026 |
| Top-quartile B2B activation rate | **40%+** | OpenView |
| Median time-to-value across B2B SaaS | **1 day 12 hours** | Userpilot 2026 |
| Top-performer time-to-value | **Under 8 minutes** | ProductLed |
| Trial conversion — opt-in (no credit card) | **8.9%** | ChartMogul 2026 |
| Trial conversion — credit card required | **31.4%** | ChartMogul 2026 |
| Cursor's freemium-to-paid conversion rate | **36%** (industry is 2–5%) | Sacra |
| Lovable's Day 30 retention (paying users) | **85%** — higher than ChatGPT | Lovable founder |
| % of B2B SaaS using reverse trial | **7%** (and rising fast) | ProductLed |
| Users who reach "aha" in <3 days vs >3 days | **90% more likely to become active** | Chameleon |
| Day 1 retention lift from optimized onboarding | **40%+ vs. 26% baseline** | UXCam |
| Churn drop from adding an onboarding checklist | **30–82%** | Userpilot |
| Activation lift from AI-adaptive onboarding | **+35–50%** | Userorbit, Chameleon |
| % of activated users who invite a collaborator in week 1 (collaborative tools) | **30–50%** | OpenView |
| NRR lift from account-based vs user-based activation | **+40–70%** | Cerebral Ops |
| Pure per-seat pricing share of SaaS | **21% → 15%** (2025 → 2026) | Bessemer |
| Hybrid base-plus-usage as new B2B standard | **41% adoption** | Bessemer |

The two numbers that should change how you build: **AI/ML products activate at 54.8% — the highest of any category** (because AI value is felt immediately when it works), and **Cursor converts free-to-paid at 36% versus a 2–5% freemium industry baseline.** That gap is not pricing. It is what happens in the first 15 minutes.

---

## The 12 Principles

These are the mental models that show up across every winning B2B AI onboarding teardown.

### 1. Time-to-Value Is the Whole Game

In B2B, the user gives you ~15 minutes before they go back to the tool they already pay for. If they have not felt the AI work on their own data inside that window, you have lost. Vercel + Supabase optimizes for <60 seconds from signup to deployed project. Cursor optimizes for first AI completion inside the editor in <5 minutes. Everything else is decoration. **If your TTV is more than a day, you are not competing in the same league as the winners.**

### 2. Show the Output Before You Ask for Setup

The mobile pattern is "ask first." The B2B AI pattern is "show first." Lovable's homepage is a prompt box that builds a real app *before* you've signed up — the signup wall fires only when the user wants to save what they just built. v0 and Bolt do the same. The signup form is now the *commitment device after the wow*, not the gate before it. Users do not need to be convinced an app exists before signing up — they need to be convinced the AI works on *them*.

### 3. The Empty State Is the Trial Killer

An empty dashboard on day one is the single most common cause of trial death. Linear ships three starter issues pre-loaded (the first one says "Create your first issue" and contains the keyboard shortcut). Notion opens to a template gallery. Cursor opens to a codebase the user already has. The blank canvas is the enemy. **Every entry point must contain a real artifact the user can act on within five seconds.**

### 4. PQLs, Not MQLs

A Product-Qualified Lead — a user whose in-product behavior signals readiness to buy — converts at 5–10x the rate of a marketing-qualified lead. The shift in 2026 is to route enterprise prospects to sales based on what they *did* in the product (created a second workspace, hit usage limits, invited the third teammate), not what they typed into a form. Sales-assisted PQLs convert at 25–35% with CAC payback under 12 months.

### 5. The Multi-User Threshold Is the Real Activation

Single-user activation is a vanity metric in B2B. Accounts with 3+ active users churn at a fraction of the rate of single-user accounts. The most important event in your funnel is not "first action" — it is "second user invited and active." Slack, Notion, and Linear all engineer this into the core loop: inviting teammates is part of doing the work, not a separate prompt. Account-based activation strategies show 40–70% higher NRR than user-based.

### 6. Connect, Don't Configure

For AI products that need to read user data — CRM, calendar, email, repo, files — the moment the user has to set up the integration is the moment they bounce. The winning pattern is *one-click OAuth with sensible defaults applied automatically.* Granola connects to Attio in one tap and starts syncing meeting notes to CRM records the same day — that's the demo. Glean's deployment time depends on data indexing, and customers cite "3 weeks to working" as the standout differentiator versus the 6–10 week norm.

### 7. AI Does the Onboarding, Not the User

The 2026 shift: instead of a tour explaining how the AI works, the AI itself generates the first artifact for the user. Gamma drafts the first deck. Cursor writes the first refactor. Lovable builds the first app. Notion AI fills in the first template. The user's onboarding is *watching the AI work*, not learning to operate it. This pattern alone drives 35–50% activation rate lift in the Userorbit and Chameleon datasets.

### 8. Trust Comes From the First Correct Answer

B2B buyers are evaluating the AI for hallucinations from second one. The first AI output the user sees determines whether they will trust the system enough to give it more data. Do not seed onboarding with a generic demo prompt — seed it with a prompt that is statistically likely to produce a high-quality, on-domain answer for *this user's profile*. Cursor's first completion is usually a refactor of code the user actually wrote. The output has to be unambiguously correct or the trial is over.

### 9. Reverse Trial Is the Most Underused Lever

A reverse trial — start the user on a free plan but give them premium features for the first 7–14 days — is used by only 7% of B2B SaaS, but the conversion behavior is dramatic: users feel premium, then "lose" features when the timer ends, triggering loss aversion at the moment they have a workflow they don't want to give up. This is the pattern Notion, Linear, and a growing number of AI products are converging on.

### 10. Cards Required Beats No-Card by 3.5x

The data is unambiguous: card-required trials convert at 31.4% versus 8.9% for opt-in trials (ChartMogul 2026). The trade-off is fewer signups, but the qualifying effect is so strong that card-required produces ~3x more paying customers per visitor. This only works if your perceived value justifies the ask before the product is tried — which is exactly what the "show before signup" landing page achieves.

### 11. Checklists Outperform Tours

Tours are the SaaS equivalent of a feature carousel — most users skip them, and the ones who don't are not the ones likely to convert. A 3–5 item progressive checklist (visible on the home screen, with the next step highlighted) drives 30–82% churn drops and 40%+ activation rates versus the 25–30% norm. Build the checklist first. Build the tour never.

### 12. Pricing Is Now Part of Onboarding

Per-seat is dying — pure per-seat pricing dropped from 21% to 15% of B2B SaaS in 12 months, and Gartner projects 40% of enterprise SaaS spend will shift to usage- or outcome-based pricing by 2030. AI agents do not consume seats — they consume actions. The winning 2026 pattern is **hybrid: a base platform fee plus consumption pricing on the AI work itself.** This shows up in onboarding because the user needs to see, on their first session, how much value-per-dollar they're getting — usage meters, credit displays, and per-action pricing visualizations are now part of the activation experience.

---

## The Decision Tree — Which Onboarding Pattern Should You Build?

Start at the top. Stop at the first "yes."

**Can you produce a working AI output on the user's own input before signup?** *(Code, design, copy, image, plan, summary, etc.)*
→ Run **#1 The Try-Before-Signup Funnel** (Lovable / v0 / Bolt pattern). Prompt box on landing page → result → signup gate to save.

**Are you a developer tool with a known integration target (repo, framework, IDE, deploy target)?**
→ Run **#2 The 15-Minute Deploy Funnel** (Vercel / Supabase / Cursor pattern). One-click connect → templated starter → first deploy/output inside 15 minutes.

**Is your value tied to a team's collaborative workflow (CRM, project management, docs, dashboards)?**
→ Run **#3 The Workspace + Sample Data Funnel** (Linear / Notion / Attio pattern). Workspace shipped pre-populated with realistic data → first edit in seconds → invite as core action.

**Does your AI read sensitive enterprise data (search, knowledge, support, security)?**
→ Run **#4 The Sandbox + Pilot Funnel** (Glean / Decagon / Sierra pattern). Sandbox demo with seeded data → forward-deployed engineer for connectors → measured pilot → expand.

**Is your AI an agent that takes actions on the user's behalf (sales, ops, support, scheduling)?**
→ Run **#5 The Agent-Build-Out Funnel** (Clay / Decagon agent pattern). Define the goal → AI proposes the workflow → user approves nodes → first run on real data.

**None of the above and you're stuck?**
→ Default to **#3 Workspace + Sample Data.** It is the highest-EV pattern for an ambiguous B2B AI product. Optimize from there.

## The 18 Tactics

Organized by stage. Build top-to-bottom.

---

### Stage 1 — Pre-Signup (the homepage and the wow moment)

#### 1. The Live Prompt Box

**Why:** The single biggest unlock in 2026 B2B AI onboarding is moving the wow moment *before* the signup form. Lovable's prompt box on the homepage generates a real working app, then asks for signup only when the user wants to keep it. v0 does the same for UI. Bolt for full-stack apps. The result: signup-to-activation rate approaches 100%, because every signup has already felt the value. Lovable went from $0 to $200M ARR in 8 months with zero paid acquisition — the prompt box *is* the funnel.

**Pass threshold:** A non-trivial AI output is produced on user input within 60 seconds of landing, before any account creation.

#### 2. The Signup Gate at "Save"

**Why:** When the wow happens before signup, the signup form is no longer asking for trust — it is asking the user to *not lose* what they just built. That is loss aversion, not friction. Make the gate trigger on the moment of value crystallization: clicking "save," "share," "export," "deploy," or "continue editing."

**Pass threshold:** Signup form appears only after the user has consumed at least one AI output. CTA copy is "Save your work" or "Keep building," never "Sign up."

#### 3. SSO Above the Email Field

**Why:** Google, Microsoft, and Apple SSO at the top of the signup screen — with the email field below as the fallback — is now standard for B2B AI. Each adds ~10–15% on signup completion. Apple Sign In is critical for iOS-originated traffic. For developer tools, GitHub OAuth is non-negotiable.

**Pass threshold:** At least 2 SSO options visible above the email field on every signup screen.

---

### Stage 2 — First 60 Seconds (workspace and intent)

#### 4. Ask Exactly One Question, And Make It Routing

**Why:** Mobile asks 20+ questions. B2B asks one. The question that matters is *intent* — "Are you here for yourself or with your team?" — because the answer changes everything downstream: solo flow vs. invite flow, individual paywall vs. team paywall, single use case vs. collaborative use case. Some products add a second question on role or industry to seed AI personalization. **Never more than two questions before the user sees the product.**

**Pass threshold:** User sees a working product surface within 30 seconds of completing the routing question.

#### 5. Ship a Pre-Populated Workspace

**Why:** Linear, Notion, Asana, Attio, Granola — every winning B2B onboarding ships a workspace that already contains realistic, on-domain data. Linear ships 3 starter issues. Notion opens to a template gallery. Attio pre-seeds a sample CRM with example deals. The user's first interaction is *editing* something real, not *creating* something from nothing. Empty workspaces convert at roughly half the rate of pre-populated ones.

**Pass threshold:** Within 5 seconds of reaching the first product surface, the user can see at least 3 realistic artifacts (records, files, projects, items) to interact with.

#### 6. The "Use My Data" Connector

**Why:** Once the user has seen the demo data and felt the AI work on it, the second-most-important moment is *replacing* the demo data with their own. One-click OAuth into Gmail, Slack, GitHub, Linear, HubSpot, Salesforce, Drive, Calendar — whatever the user's actual context is. Granola hooks Attio in one tap and starts syncing meeting notes the same day. Glean cites "3 weeks to working" as their differentiator — most enterprise AI deployments need 6–10. **Connector setup is the moat. The faster yours is, the faster trials become contracts.**

**Pass threshold:** Single-click OAuth for top 3–5 relevant integrations, visible on the first dashboard.

---

### Stage 3 — The First AI Output (the AI's first impression)

#### 7. The Suggested Prompt Rail

**Why:** AI products live or die on the user's first prompt. New users do not know what to ask, and the wrong first prompt produces a bad first answer and a closed tab. A horizontal rail of 4–6 suggested prompts — specific to the user's stated role/industry, ranked by likelihood of a high-quality response — is now standard. Cursor's "Ask about this file," ChatGPT's prompt suggestions, Granola's "Summarize last week" all do this. The suggestions are not optional decoration. They are the script the AI is statistically guaranteed to perform well on.

**Pass threshold:** 4–6 suggested prompts visible on the first AI-input surface. Each must be high-confidence — pre-evaluated to produce a strong response.

#### 8. The "Show Your Work" AI Output

**Why:** The first AI output must show its reasoning, sources, or confidence. Hallucination is the central trust barrier in B2B AI, and the only durable defense is transparency. Citations linked back to source documents (Glean's model), visible chain-of-thought summaries (Granola), or "AI worked on these 12 files" indicators (Cursor) all serve the same function: they tell the user the AI is *grounded*, not making things up. Trust is built in the first answer or it is never built.

**Pass threshold:** Every AI output in onboarding shows at least one of: citations, source links, confidence indicator, or visible reasoning steps.

#### 9. The Generated Artifact, Not the Generated Answer

**Why:** A chat response evaporates. A generated *artifact* — a doc, a deck, a dashboard, a workflow, a piece of code — persists. The artifact is the bridge between "I tried the AI" and "I have something I don't want to lose." Lovable generates an entire app. Cursor generates committed code. Gamma generates a deck. Granola generates a CRM record. The first AI output should always produce a persisted, named, ownable artifact in the user's workspace.

**Pass threshold:** Every first AI interaction produces an artifact that appears in the user's workspace tree, with a name, a timestamp, and a share URL.

---

### Stage 4 — The Activation Checklist (the next 10 minutes)

#### 10. The 3–5 Item Checklist, Always Visible

**Why:** Progressive checklists drive the largest single conversion lift in the B2B onboarding literature — 30–82% churn drops, 40%+ activation rates. The format that wins: 3–5 items, persistently visible (sidebar or header), with progress percentage, the next step highlighted, and dismissible only after completion. Items must produce real product outcomes, not tutorials — "Create your first project," "Invite a teammate," "Connect your data," "Run your first AI task," "Save your first artifact."

**Pass threshold:** Checklist visible on every screen for the first 7 days. Each item triggers a real product action, not an explainer.

#### 11. The Second-User Invite As the Second Step

**Why:** The most important conversion event in B2B SaaS is not the first user's first action — it is the second user joining. Make the invite flow the second item in the checklist (after the first AI output), not the last. Pre-fill the invite UI with detected teammates from the user's domain. Offer one-click "invite everyone at @company.com." For tools where collaboration is the value (Linear, Notion, Slack, Attio), the invite is part of the work — every action surfaces a "share with…" prompt.

**Pass threshold:** Invite prompt appears within the first 3 minutes of post-signup product use, with at least one pre-filled suggested teammate.

#### 12. The Per-Role First Action

**Why:** Different teammates need different first actions. The engineer needs the repo connected. The PM needs the project board populated. The designer needs the file imported. When an invited user joins, do not drop them into the same onboarding the inviter saw — drop them into a role-specific first action that depends on the inviter's setup. This is the Slack / Notion playbook: invited users see the document/channel they were invited to, not a generic tour.

**Pass threshold:** Invited users land directly on the artifact they were invited to, with a 1-action contextual prompt — not the inviter's onboarding.

---

### Stage 5 — The Trial-to-Paid Transition (days 3–14)

#### 13. The Reverse Trial

**Why:** Default the user onto the free plan, but unlock premium features for 7–14 days. When the trial ends, premium features become locked, but the user's data and workflows stay. This triggers loss aversion at the moment the user has a workflow they don't want to lose — and gives you a non-fatal way to introduce the paywall. Only 7% of B2B SaaS use this today. The early adopters (Notion, Linear, Lovable, increasing share of AI products) are seeing meaningful conversion lift over straight freemium or straight trial models.

**Pass threshold:** First 7–14 days unlock premium features by default. The downgrade event is clearly previewed in-app at least 48 hours in advance.

#### 14. The Card-At-The-Value Moment

**Why:** Card-required at signup converts at 31.4% versus 8.9% for opt-in, but the cost is volume. The middle path that's winning in 2026: ask for card at the moment of high intent inside the product — when the user invites their third teammate, hits a usage limit, or tries to save their second artifact. This produces 2.1x higher conversion than no-card trials while maintaining 3x more trial starts than upfront card-required.

**Pass threshold:** Card request fires inside the product at a specific behavioral trigger, not at signup and not at trial expiration.

#### 15. The Usage Meter as a Trust Signal

**Why:** AI products are increasingly priced on usage — tokens, runs, credits, actions. A visible usage meter in onboarding does two jobs simultaneously: it shows the user how cheap their usage is *right now* (a trust signal), and it primes them for the upgrade conversation when they approach the limit. Cursor's request counter, ChatGPT's plus indicator, Lovable's credits balance all do this. The meter is not a paywall — it is a value-per-dollar visualization that converts to a paywall later.

**Pass threshold:** Usage / credit / quota visible on the home screen from day 1, with clear unit economics ("$0.02 per query," "100 credits/mo on free").

---

### Stage 6 — The Long Game (week 2 and beyond)

#### 16. The Behavior-Triggered Upgrade

**Why:** The 2026 conversion winner is in-product upgrade triggers fired at specific PQL behaviors — creating a second workspace, inviting the third teammate, hitting 80% of the usage limit, attempting to use a premium feature. These convert at 15–30% versus 2–5% for time-based or pop-up upgrade nudges. Build at least 3 distinct trigger points, each with its own offer logic and exit copy.

**Pass threshold:** At least 3 distinct in-product upgrade triggers, each fired on a behavior (not a timer), each with conversion measured independently.

#### 17. The Sales-Assist Handoff

**Why:** For ACVs above ~$5K, the highest-ROI move is to route PQL behaviors to a human sales rep with full behavioral context — not to ask the user to "book a demo." When an enterprise-shaped user (verified work email, >10-person team, repeat usage) hits a PQL threshold, a sales rep should reach out with a personalized message referencing what the user actually did. Sales-assisted PQLs convert at 25–35% with CAC payback under 12 months, and enterprise sales cycles shorten by 28%.

**Pass threshold:** Automated routing of PQL behaviors to sales reps for accounts above a configurable size threshold, with the rep seeing in-product activity history before reaching out.

#### 18. The Expansion Loop

**Why:** B2B AI's growth model is not acquisition — it is expansion. The same account that signed up with one user should grow to 5, then 20, then 100. Bake expansion triggers into onboarding from day 1: every artifact has a share button, every workspace has an invite prompt, every report has an export-to-team flow. Granola's path with Attio is the template: a single team adopts the tool, the AI starts producing artifacts that show up in other teams' tools, and adoption spreads laterally. Build the loop in onboarding, not as a Q3 growth initiative.

**Pass threshold:** Every persisted artifact has a share / invite / export action visible by default. Onboarding includes at least one "show this to your team" prompt.

## Worked Example 1 — The Cursor Funnel Reconstructed

This is the approximate Cursor flow as documented across Sacra's $100M ARR teardown, Aakash Gupta's growth case study, and the Notion self-serve onboarding template. Cursor went from $1M to $100M ARR in 12 months — the fastest SaaS company in history — with **zero marketing spend** and a 36% freemium-to-paid conversion rate (versus a 2–5% industry baseline).

| Step | Pattern | Why It Works |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Landing page demos AI code edits | Show before signup | User sees the AI's actual output style before installing |
| 2. Download for Mac/Windows/Linux | Native install, not browser | Signals "this is a real dev tool" |
| 3. Open Cursor, import VS Code settings in one click | Zero-config switching | The user's existing config is the starter workspace |
| 4. Point Cursor at an existing repo | User's real data, not demo | The first AI output is on real code the user wrote |
| 5. First inline completion fires within seconds | Live AI demo on user data | The wow moment is the first auto-complete on actual code |
| 6. Cmd-K to ask the AI to refactor | Suggested first action | User experiences "agent" mode on real code |
| 7. Composer / agent mode generates a multi-file change | Generated artifact | Persisted, reviewable, committable |
| 8. Free tier with usage counter visible | Usage meter as trust signal | User sees value-per-dollar in real time |
| 9. Hit free limit → upgrade prompt at $20/mo | Behavior-triggered upgrade | The user upgrades at the moment of dependence |
| 10. Business plan upsell at team usage threshold | Expansion to team | Per-developer, but volume drives team adoption |

**Result:** $100M ARR in 12 months, $1B ARR in 24, 36% freemium-to-paid conversion, ~360,000 paying developers, ACV $276. Team of <20 people. Zero marketing budget.

> **The takeaway is not "build a code editor."** It is "the first product surface the user touches must be operating on their own data, and the AI must produce a correct output before they've done any configuration." Cursor's onboarding is invisible because the product is the onboarding.

---

## Worked Example 2 — The Lovable Funnel Reconstructed

Lovable went from $0 to $100M ARR in 8 months, then doubled to $200M in 4 more — with **zero paid acquisition** and **85% Day 30 retention** (higher than ChatGPT). The funnel is short, brutal, and built around a single insight: the wow moment must precede signup, not follow it.

| Step | Pattern | Why It Works |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Landing page is a prompt box | Try-before-signup | User describes an app idea in plain English |
| 2. AI builds a working web app live | Pre-signup wow | The output is a real, navigable app inside ~60 seconds |
| 3. User tries to save / continue → signup gate | Loss aversion as the conversion lever | Signup is asked at the moment the user wants to keep what they built |
| 4. SSO with Google / GitHub | Single-tap account creation | Zero friction once value is felt |
| 5. Workspace opens with the user's just-built app | Continuity from pre-signup | No empty state — the artifact is already there |
| 6. Suggested edits: "Add login," "Add database," "Add Stripe" | Suggested prompt rail | Each suggestion is a high-confidence next move |
| 7. Free credits visible, with clear per-action pricing | Usage meter | User sees the model and the value-per-credit |
| 8. Community gallery ("Launched") shows what others built | Social proof + loop | Every published app is acquisition fuel |
| 9. Credit exhaustion triggers upgrade | Behavior-triggered upgrade | Upgrade happens at the moment of momentum, not on a timer |
| 10. Team plan at second-builder threshold | Multi-user expansion | The second collaborator unlocks the team SKU |

**Result:** $200M ARR in 12 months. 85% Day 30 retention. Zero paid acquisition. Open-source flywheel doing acquisition work that competitors spend $50M to manufacture.

---

## Worked Example 3 — The Linear/Workspace Funnel

For collaborative B2B AI products without a pre-signup wow surface (most CRM, project management, knowledge tools, support tools), the pattern is workspace-first, populated, invite-driven.

| Step | Pattern | Why It Works |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Single-question intent screen ("Solo or team?") | Routing question | Branches solo vs. team flow without slowing anyone down |
| 2. Workspace shipped with 3 starter issues + 1 sample project | Pre-populated workspace | Zero empty state — first action is editing something real |
| 3. First issue contains the keyboard shortcut explainer | Learn-by-doing | Tutorial embedded in the first artifact |
| 4. AI-suggested issue tagging fires on first edit | Live AI on user data | Trust built on the first interaction |
| 5. Persistent 3-item checklist (Create issue / Invite / Connect Slack) | Always-visible checklist | Drives 40%+ activation vs. 25–30% baseline |
| 6. Invite teammates with detected @company.com pre-fill | Frictionless multi-user | Detected teammates removed the typing |
| 7. Connected Slack pushes notifications to a real channel | Cross-tool surface area | Forces lateral spread |
| 8. Premium features unlocked for 14 days (reverse trial) | Loss aversion at expiry | Conversion at the cliff edge |
| 9. Card prompt fires on third invited teammate | Card-at-the-value-moment | Captures payment after team utility is felt |
| 10. Usage report emailed weekly to admins | Expansion artifact | Forces lateral adoption inside the company |

## Anti-Patterns — What Kills B2B AI Onboarding

These are the recurring failure patterns from the teardowns.

### The Tour Carousel

A 4-screen "Here's what you can do" carousel before the product. Skip rate is 60–80% and the users who *do* sit through it are not the users who convert. Tours have lost to checklists in every recent A/B test in the public literature. **Replace with a 3-item checklist on the home screen.**

### The Empty Dashboard

A blank dashboard with "Get started by creating your first…" Drop-off here is the single largest source of trial death in B2B SaaS onboarding. **Replace with pre-populated demo content the user can edit.**

### The 12-Field Signup Form

Asking for company size, role, industry, use case, team size, and phone number before showing the product. Each additional field above 3 reduces signup completion by ~10%. **Cut to email + password (or just SSO). Capture everything else through behavior.**

### The Demo-Booking Wall

Hiding the trial behind a "Talk to sales" button. This is a relic of pre-PLG B2B. For ACV under ~$25K, every demo-required gate is a 90%+ conversion loss. **Default to self-serve. Trigger sales on PQL behavior, not on signup intent.**

### The Generic First Prompt

Letting the user type their first AI query into a blank box with no suggestions. The first prompt is the highest-stakes prompt — a bad output here kills trust forever. **Always seed with 4–6 high-confidence suggested prompts on the first AI surface.**

### The Hallucination Without Receipts

An AI output with no citations, no sources, no confidence indicators. B2B buyers are scanning for hallucinations from second one — if you don't show your work, you've already lost trust. **Every AI output in onboarding must show provenance.**

### The Per-Seat Default

Pricing a 2026 AI agent product per seat without thinking through the agent's consumption pattern. Customers in 2026 are explicitly avoiding pure per-seat in renewal negotiations because they don't want to be locked into a model that breaks as they replace seats with agents. **Default to hybrid: a base platform fee plus usage-based AI pricing.**

### The "Connect Salesforce First" Wall

Requiring an integration before showing any value. Connector setup is a multi-step process owned by IT, and a B2B trial that requires it has already lost the user. **Always ship with sample data. Integrations are a *step*, not a *gate*.**

### The Three-Plan Pricing Page With 47 Features

A pricing page with three plans, side-by-side feature matrix, and 47 line items. Users do not read these. The 2026 winner is **one default plan, one anchor, one toggle** — exactly like mobile. Enterprise calculators and seat counters belong on a separate page after the user is qualified, not on the marketing site.

### The "Welcome Email" That Asks for a Demo

The first transactional email post-signup should not be a sales rep asking for time. It should be the artifact the user just built, with one CTA back into the product. Save the human reach-out for the PQL trigger.

## Calibration — What Good Looks Like

If your B2B AI onboarding is performing well, these are the marks to hit.

| Metric | Floor | Good | Best-in-class |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Landing-to-signup conversion | 3% | 8% | 15%+ |
| Signup-to-first-AI-output completion | 40% | 65% | 85%+ |
| Time to first AI output | 10 min | 2 min | <60 sec |
| Activation rate (first meaningful AI action) | 30% | 45% | 55%+ |
| Time-to-value | 2 days | 24 hrs | <8 min |
| % of activated users who invite a second user (week 1) | 15% | 30% | 50%+ |
| Free-to-paid conversion (freemium) | 3% | 10% | 25%+ |
| Trial-to-paid conversion (CC-required) | 25% | 40% | 55%+ |
| Day 30 retention (paying users) | 70% | 85% | 92%+ |
| Time-to-PQL | 7 days | 3 days | <24 hrs |
| Net revenue retention (NRR) | 100% | 115% | 130%+ |

If you are below the floor on signup-to-first-AI-output or time-to-first-AI-output, the fix is almost never the pricing — it is the empty state, the suggested prompts, or the data connector flow. Re-read principles #1, #3, and #7.

## The B2B AI Onboarding Operating Model

Most teams treat onboarding as a project — design it once, ship it, move on. The companies winning in 2026 treat it as a continuously-tuned operating system. The four ongoing functions:

**1. Telemetry on every screen.** Every transition in the funnel is instrumented. Drop-off > 15% on any single screen triggers a review.

**2. Weekly experimentation cadence.** A new variant on at least one screen every week. Cursor and Lovable both ran dozens of experiments per quarter inside the first year. Cal AI (the mobile equivalent) ran 123 paywall experiments in the year before MyFitnessPal acquired them.

**3. PQL routing automation.** Every behavior crossing a defined threshold either fires an upgrade trigger or routes to a human. No PQL signal is allowed to die in a CRM unactioned.

**4. Quarterly empty-state audits.** Every entry point a user can land in (invited to a doc, opened a tab, returned after a week) is audited for whether it contains a clear next action and real artifact. Empty-state regressions are the most common silent killer.

## Closing — The One Mental Model That Beats Everything

> **In B2B AI, the user is silently asking "Can I trust this to do my job?" at every screen. Your only job is to make the answer "yes" through demonstration, not explanation — until the user has done their job *with* the AI and cannot remember how they used to do it without.**

The mobile playbook is persuasion. The B2B playbook is *evidence.* Every screen, every prompt, every artifact is evidence that the AI works, on this user's data, in this user's domain, at this user's standard of quality. If the evidence is strong enough, fast enough, and clean enough — pricing barely matters. Cursor charges $20/month into a category dominated by free open-source alternatives and converts 36% of free users. That is not a pricing miracle. It is what happens when the product earns trust on impression one and never gives a buyer a reason to doubt it after.

That is how you build B2B AI software that scales without a sales team — and how you turn the trial into the moat.
