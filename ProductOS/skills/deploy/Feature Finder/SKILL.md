name: feature-finder
description: Use inside an app codebase when the user wants feature or change recommendations to achieve a specific objective. Triggers on phrases like "what should I build next", "find features to improve retention", "how do I get more users to upgrade", "recommend features", "what would increase activation", "feature ideas for my app", or any request to translate a business goal (retention, activation, conversion, revenue, referrals, engagement) into concrete product changes. Asks for the objective, reviews the codebase to understand what the app does today, researches live best practices and what comparable products have done, then delivers ranked feature recommendations with evidence, effort estimates, and how to measure each — and offers to add the chosen ones to the plan file.

# Feature Finder

Turn a business objective into ranked, evidence-backed feature recommendations grounded in what the app actually is today — not generic growth advice.

## 1. Pin down the objective

Ask what the user wants to achieve. If they're vague, offer the common shapes: activation (more users reach the core value), retention (they come back), conversion (free → paid), revenue per user, referrals/virality, engagement depth, or reduced churn. Push until the objective is measurable — *"improve retention"* becomes *"more users return in week 2."* One objective per session; mixing goals produces mush.

## 2. Review the codebase

Read the repository to understand the product as built: what it does, the core user journey (entry → value → return), existing features, pricing/paywall surfaces, onboarding, notifications/emails, and what analytics or instrumentation exist. If product docs are present (e.g. `docs/PRODUCT.md`, a PRD, a roadmap), read them for the customer, magic moment, and what's already planned — don't recommend what's already on the roadmap. Note the stack, since it bounds what's cheap vs. expensive to build.

## 3. Research what works

Research the objective live — current best practices for this product category, and specifically what named comparable products have done with documented results (e.g. Duolingo's streaks for retention, Dropbox's referral storage, Superhuman's onboarding for activation). Prioritize documented outcomes over listicle advice. Map each pattern against this app: does the mechanism that made it work exist here?

## 4. Recommend

Present 5–8 candidates, ranked by expected impact against effort. For each:

- **The feature or change** — concrete enough to picture, specific to this app (name the screens/flows it touches).
- **Why it should work** — the mechanism, with the comparable product and its documented result.
- **Effort** — S/M/L given the actual stack and codebase.
- **How to measure** — the metric that proves it moved the objective, and whether the app can currently measure it (if not, instrumentation is part of the work).
- **Risk or trade-off** — honestly stated; e.g. notification fatigue, paywall friction, scope creep.

Lead with your top 3 in detail; list the rest briefly. Include at least one cheap, unglamorous option (copy, ordering, or friction-removal changes often beat new features) and flag any recommendation that's fashionable but a poor fit for this product.

## 5. Hand off

Discuss and let the user pick. For chosen recommendations, offer to add them as properly formatted tasks to the plan file (roadmap or task list) if one exists — sized, ordered, with verification steps — ready for a build-loop skill to execute. If no plan exists, offer to write the chosen recommendations up as one.

## Rules

- Every recommendation must trace to the stated objective — no pet features.
- Evidence over instinct: name the comparable, cite the documented result, and say when evidence is thin.
- Respect what exists: recommendations build on the current codebase and stack, not an imaginary rewrite.
- Be honest when the objective's biggest lever isn't a feature at all (pricing, positioning, distribution) — say so and point at the right phase instead of inventing product work.
